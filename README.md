## Overview

The Project Name is a banking system that allows users to authenticate, manage their accounts, and perform various banking operations. This document provides an overview of the system, installation instructions, system architecture, API specifications, and other relevant documentation.

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd project-name
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the configuration:
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the environment variables with your configuration details (e.g., database connection URL, JWT secret, etc.).

5. Run the application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## System Architecture

The banking system follows a backend-focused architecture, built with Node.js and Express.js. The system utilizes a RESTful API to handle client-server communication and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

The key components of the system include:

- **Controllers**: Responsible for handling incoming requests, processing data, and generating responses.
- **Models**: Represent the data entities and handle interactions with the database.
- **Routes**: Define the API endpoints and their corresponding controllers.
- **Middlewares**: Provide additional functionalities such as authentication, request validation, error handling, etc.
- **Database**: Stores user and account data. In this project, we use MySQL as the database system.

## API Specifications

The banking system exposes the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) for subsequent requests.
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```
  - Response:
    ```json
    {
      "token": "your-jwt-token"
    }
    ```

- `GET /api/accounts`: Retrieves the accounts associated with the authenticated user.
  - Request Header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
    ```
  - Response:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "accountNumber": "1234567890",
        "balance": 1000.0
      },
      ...
    ]
    ```

- `POST /api/accounts`: Creates a new account for the authenticated user.
  - Request Header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
    ```
  - Request Body:
